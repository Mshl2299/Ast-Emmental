AST-Emmental is an arcade-style game inspired by classics including Asteroids and Snake. 
This game, coded mostly from scratch in HTML/CSS/JS was made as part of my Capstone Project.

## Issues, bugs, feedback, suggestions :ant:
Please go to the **Issues** tab if you experience any major bugs, and press "New Issue" if you do not see your bug already there.
I will try my best to fix these issues, although it may take a while. I release fixes in bulk whenever there's an update.

*Note: The asteroid hitboxes are squares for now, so watch out for the corners!*

Feedback and suggestions are very welcome! Please head over to the **Discussions** tab if you have something you want to share.
If I have time, I will try to update the game.
